## Key Learning Points and Improvements that Can be Made
- I learned a lot in this project I learned that I was not the best at collaborating but I will learn from my mistakes and will work on my collaboration skill so that   I can be a good teammate. I will make sure that I will not repeat the same mistake. Other then that as a team we are a good and encouraging team like if we a         teammate needs any help everyone will provide the that the person needs. We all go well together, we did not get into any conflicts but, we are not perfect like. We   could have improved our timing and some work of styling but overall we were on point and almost perfect with our work and I would like to work with them again.

Thank you for reading.
