We are in Unit-3 from Web-16 Batch and students of

Masai School

at the end of unit Masai team is assigned a project and the project is based on the technology we are learned in the whole unit in this project we are used HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT(Es6) and APIs

## Technologies we used
- HTML , CSS
- JAVASCRIPT
- Browser Local Storage for Cart Section
-Google and Facebook Api’s for a quick Login and Signup
This is my story of the making of beardo.in project. In this project I learned a lot and did some mistakes as well but because my teammates are understanding of my mistakes I was able to learn from my mistakes. I had lot of fun building this web and we succeeded in building almost a picture perfect clone of the real website we are all proud of it. In this project I mainly did work on login and sign up page and in that I used the real google’s and facebook’s OAuth(Open Authorization) to build the the google and facebook sign in so anyone who uses google and facebook can easily sign up so you don’t have to go through the process of making a account we can directly identify your profile from google and facebook. I had to go through a lot of hassle to make it work but in the end I was successfully able to implement it. So yeah I am proud of it.

Key Learning Points and Improvements that Can be Made →
I learned a lot in this project I learned that I was not the best at collaborating but I will learn from my mistakes and will work on my collaboration skill so that I can be a good teammate. I will make sure that I will not repeat the same mistake. Other then that as a team we are a good and encouraging team like if we a teammate needs any help everyone will provide the that the person needs. We all go well together, we did not get into any conflicts but, we are not perfect like. We could have improved our timing and some work of styling but overall we were on point and almost perfect with our work and I would like to work with them again.

Thank you for reading.
